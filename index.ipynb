    "\n",
    "* In deep learning a training, validation and test set are used when iteratively building the right deep networks\n",
    "* Like traditional machine learning models, we need to watch out for the bias variance trade-off when building deep learning models\n",
    "* Several regularization techniques can help us limit overfitting: L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, Dropout Regularization,...\n",
    "* Deep network training can be sped up by using normalized inputs\n",
    "* Normalized inputs can also help mitigate a common issue of vanishing or exploding gradients\n",
    "* You learned about gradient descent, but in deep learning some other optimization algorithms are introduced that work faster than gradient descent\n",
    "* Examples of alternatives for gradient descent are: RMSprop, Adam, Gradient Descent with Momentum\n",
    "* Hyperparameter tuning is of crucial important when working with deep learning models, as setting the parameters right can lead to great model improvements"
